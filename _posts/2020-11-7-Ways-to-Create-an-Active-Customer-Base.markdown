# 4 Ways to Create Active Customer Base

An active customer base is the key to Business growth and increased profits. Keeping your customers coming back to your business not only creates more value per customer, but also makes it easier to attain new customers as word about your business spreads throughout their social circles. To maintain an active and growing base of customers, it is important to ensure your business stays in frequent contact with your customers and remains valuable to them. Did you know that just a 5 percent increase in customer retention can result in a 75 percent increase in customer value? There are a few ways this can be done, including Rewards programs, sales and promotions, newsletters and email lists, and others listed below.


## Rewards Programs

Rewards programs can be a great way to incentivize your patrons to return, and they may also be a great way to keep track of your frequent customers. During the sign up process, requiring the customer to enter their gender, age, and other non identifiable information can be a great way to gather vital customer analytics.


## Email Lists & Newsletters

There is a reason why companies love to send email advertisements, updates, and coupons to their customers. Gauging customer interaction with these emails can be a great way to identify your most active customer base. Creating sweepstakes, asking open ended questions, and requesting read receipts to these emails can all be great ways to encourage a response from the email recipients. This is also a great way to ensure your potential customers stay current & informed with what your business has to offer.

## Ask for Opinions!

It is important that your customers feel like their opinions are valued. By adding a short survey either on your website or on the email newsletter, you can take the pulse of your customer base to see how satisfied they are with your offerings, and make any changes if needed. 


## Customer Support

Having good [customer support](https://www.superoffice.com/blog/five-ways-to-deliver-excellent-customer-service/) is vital to any Business in the hospitality industry, and treating each customer with respect and dignity no matter what the issue is can help your business grow with loyal customers who know their needs will be taken care of. A satisified customer is much more likely to tell their friends about a positive experience with your business, and this can help grow your sales as customers keep coming back for more.

## Keep your website current

A great website is like an open door into your business, inviting potential customers in with your current deals, business offerings, and specials. By having a good website that stays up to date with what you are offering, you are much more likely to have people visit your business because of what they read about on your website. Maintaining a healthy website also allows your business to rise in the ranks of search engines, making your business easier to find.

## Social Media

Many potential customers look to social media to stay up to date with the best restaurants, bars, and businesses to visit. By maintaining an active social media presence and interacting with users through likes, comments, and posting pictures, your business gains an advantage to reaching out to new customers who might not find you through google or other means.


## Giveaways & Sweepstakes
