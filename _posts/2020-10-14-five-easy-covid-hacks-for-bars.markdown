# 5 Easy COVID Hacks for Bars

<br/>

## Outdoor Seating/Standing

COVID-19 spreads slower outdoors. If you do not have outdoor seating already available, it may be worth using part of your parking lot to increase the space between your patrons.


## Require Facemasks

We know you are a bar, but it is important for your patrons to wear their face masks if they want to be able to enjoy coming to your business during the pandemic.


## Group Seating

If you can space out groups 6 feet apart, you will be able to fit more people in an area while following CDC guidelines


## Enforce Social Distancing

You will need to enforce the social distancing if you do not want to become a hot spot.


## Capacity Tracking

CDC reccomends cutting your occupancy in half. A good way to track this is with [**identex**](https://identex.co)!
